2:teaspoons:canola oil:Any Neutral oil will do. IE. Brown Nut etc
 : :Kosher Salt: 
 : :Pepper: 
2:tablespoons:Butter: 
_Salt your steak in advance - 45 minutes before cooking (Alternatively if you wish to not wait, Salt your steak JUST before you place it in the pan):Oil the pan with 1-2 teaspoons of oil (Cast-Iron skillets are preferred):Heat the pan over high heat until the oil starts to lightly smoke.  Then it's time to put the steaks on!:Add steaks carefully to the pan.  Start with the end closest to you and lay it backwards. (That way if you accidently drop the steak, the hot oil splashes away from you rather than onto you!):Cook steak for 3-6 minutes per side.  Use tongs or a spatula to flip the steak. When flipping if the steak has a bone, be sure to grab the bone with the tongs when flipping to prevent the meat separating from the bone on accident!:Add 2 tablespoons of butter to the pan 2-minutes before the steak is done.:Tilt the pan and spoon the melted butter on top of the steak evenly. (This is called Basting):Use a thermometer to test doneness.:120° F (48.8° C) = Rare:130° F (54.4° C) = Medium rare:140° F (60° C) = Medium:150° F (65.5° C) = Medium well:160° F (71.1° C) = Well done:Let your steak rest 5 to 10 minutes after you remove it from the pan.:After the steak has rested, enjoy your wonderful creation!:NOTES- There are two schools of thought for flipping steaks.  Only flip once, or flip frequently, try both and see which you like best!:When adding the butter, that is the step to add additional aromatics if you so wish (IE. Rosemary, Lavender, Thyme, Sage, Garlic):While your steak is resting if you cooked with aromatics, pour them on the steak to rest with it, and clear them off after the steak is done resting to impart even more flavor:If you find that you're steak is turning out slightly overdone (IE more Medium than Medium Rare), then pull it off about 5° F before the steak is done, this will allow it to stay within the desired doneness range since the steak continues cooking for a little bit while resting (which could be the likely culprit of the slight overdoneness!).

Use a thermometer to determine how long your oven needs specifically. (120F Rare, 130F Medium Rare, 140F Medium, 150F Medium well, 160F Well-done):Once you have your steak at its desired doneness, remove from the oven and let it rest for 5 minutes before serving.
